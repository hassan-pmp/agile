- **Doing Agile** means following the practices—like running sprints, holding stand-ups, or using a Scrum board. It’s mostly about the process and tools.

- 1- **How do you explain the difference between doing Agile and being Agile?**
- **Being Agile** is deeper—it's about mindset. It means embracing values like collaboration, adaptability, continuous learning, and delivering value to the customer early and often. A team can do all the Agile ceremonies but still resist change or avoid feedback. When they are Agile, they **welcome change**, **improve continuously**, and **take ownership**.

- 2- **How would you handle a team that is following Agile rituals but lacks an Agile mindset?**
  - First, I would observe their behavior during ceremonies and in their day-to-day work. Then, I would have 1:1 conversations or team workshops to understand their perspective and where the resistance comes from.
  - Next, I’d try to connect Agile principles to their goals—like faster delivery or reduced rework. I’d also introduce small experiments like retrospective follow-through or shared sprint goals, to build trust in the process. Over time, with coaching and wins, the mindset often shifts from “we have to do this” to “this helps us.”

- 3. **What’s your approach to cultivating psychological safety in high-pressure R&D environments?**
  -  I start by modeling vulnerability myself—admitting when I don’t know something or when I’ve made a mistake. This shows the team that it’s okay to be human. Then, I work with team leads and senior engineers to reinforce a culture where questions are welcomed, feedback is given respectfully, and failures are treated as learning opportunities, not blame games.

- 4- **What would you do if a team member or stakeholder consistently resists Agile practices?**
  - First, I try to understand the reason behind the resistance. Is it fear of change? Lack of understanding? Past bad experiences? I usually have a 1:1 conversation to listen and empathize.
  - Then, I work on building trust by clarifying the “why” behind Agile practices and showing how they solve real problems the person is facing—like delays, miscommunication, or rework.
  - If it’s a stakeholder, I focus on translating Agile benefits into business language—like faster time to market, better risk management, or clearer visibility. I’ve learned that resistance often fades when people see results or feel heard and involved.
- 5- **Who do you think is a good person for this position? In terms of characteristics, knowledge, and more**
  - Empathetic and a good listener
  -  Technically curious
  -  Calm under pressure
  -  Strong in facilitation and conflict resolution
  -

The Developers suggest only having the Daily Scrum every two days. Which responses would be most appropriate from yourself? (choose 3)
  -  Coach the team on why having a Daily Scrum every day is an important opportunity to update the Sprint plan and how it helps the team self-organize work toward achieving the Sprint Goal.
  -  Help the team understand that lowering the frequency of communication will only increase the feeling of disconnect between the team members.
  -  Point out that having less frequent Daily Scrums means less frequent opportunities to inspect and adapt introducing risk of undesired deviation from the Sprint Goal. The Sprint plan might become inaccurate with reduced transparency over progress toward the Sprint Goal.

- 14- How does Scrum apply Empiricism? (choose 3)
  -  Scrum Artifacts help with transparency.
  -  One or more artifacts are inspected in each event.
  -  During each Scrum Event, decisions are made on one or more artifacts.

- 15- One of the developers is disruptive and constantly disagrees with the team, this developer is slowing the decision-making progress and has started disregarding the team’s decisions and making his own decisions. What should you do as the Scrum Master? (choose the best 2 answers)
  -  To anyone expressing this concern you suggest raising this with the entire team. You offer to help facilitate the conversation but not to resolve the concern yourself.
  -  At the Sprint Retrospective, you wait to see if this topic is raised. If it does not happen, you raise it checking how everyone feels with the way team decisions are made.

- 16- What is the best description of the Definition of Done? (choose 3)
  -  It creates transparency of the state of the Increment for inspection at the Sprint Review.
  -  It helps the Developers identify the work remaining for an Increment to be ready for release.
  -  At Sprint Planning it guides the Developers when creating a forecast for items.

- 17- Which two items best describe what ‘done’ means? (choose 2)
  -  All the work performed as defined in the Definition of Done.
  -  Having an Increment of working software that is potentially releasable to the end users.

- 18- The Sprint Review often overruns resulting in many stakeholders needing to leave before the end of the meeting and missing key information. The stakeholders request to have a follow-up meeting the next day. As a Scrum Master how would you handle this situation? (choose 2)
  - Coach the stakeholders to understand Scrum and that all events are timeboxed and should not be extended.
  - Coach the Developers with time management techniques and how to present the most valuable functionalities first.

- 19- You join an established Scrum team as the new Scrum Master, you notice that the Product Owner has not been attending the Sprint Retrospectives. Through some investigation, you realise that the Developers don’t want to invite him fearing that he might make the Sprint Retrospective ineffective and even provide destructive criticism. As the new Scrum Master what should you do? (choose the best answer)
  - Work with the Developers to explore the problem and find a safe way to introduce the Product Owner to the Sprint Retrospective to enable greater transparency.

- 20- You have a choice of ways and locations to hold the Daily Scrum, how do you decide what option is best? (choose 1)
  - It should be held wherever the Developers think is best.

- 21- You are a Scrum Master for three Scrum Teams who are all working on the same Product. Management wants to measure the velocity of all three teams so that they know which teams are working well and which teams may benefit from more assistance. What are your best responses? (choose 2)
  - Velocity is the amount of business functionality that a particular Scrum Team creates in a Sprint. It is unique to that team and used to forecast work in Sprint Planning.
  - There is no direct relationship between velocity and value. Value of the increment to the stakeholders is measured in other ways.

- 22- During a Daily Scrum 2 developers disagree on a task and get into a heated argument, what Scrum Value are they not showing?
 - Respect

- 23- Two Scrum teams are working on the same product. In the coming Sprints some of the Developers have realised that both teams are going to need the help of Chris, an external specialist who is the only person with the knowledge and authority to build the database environment. However, Chris is notoriously busy and has already said he can only spare enough of his time for one Scrum team per Sprint. What should the Scrum Master do? (choose 1)
  - Facilitate a discussion with all Developers from both teams on how they want to deal with this issue, and help them implement their preferred solution.

- 24- 3 Scrum teams are working in a Nexus on the same Product. At the Sprint Review, each team tells the Product Owner that their increments are ready for release but they show their Increments independently in different environments. Would this be cause for concern?
  - Yes
- 25- One of the developers is disruptive and constantly disagrees with the team, this developer is slowing the decision-making progress and has started disregarding the team’s decisions and making his own decisions. What should you do as the Scrum Master? (choose the best 2 answers)
  - At the Sprint Retrospective, you wait to see if this topic is raised. If it does not happen, you raise it checking how everyone feels with the way team decisions are made.
  - To anyone expressing this concern you suggest raising this with the entire team. You offer to help facilitate the conversation but not to resolve the concern yourself.

- 26- When multiple Scrum teams are working from the same Product Backlog, how should the work be distributed between teams?
  - The Developers from each team pull in work from a shared Product Backlog in agreement with the Product Owner and the other teams.

- 27- At the Sprint Retrospective the Scrum Team are addressing the quality difficulties that prevented completing an appropriate Increment at Sprint end. However, the Developments did indicate that they were able to accomplish a high velocity. Which two of these responses would you think their Scrum Master is best to take? (choose 2)
  - Stress the value of working software over measured velocity
  - Facilitate a discussion on how to improve the quality to a level high enough for the Increment to be releasable, even if the measured velocity drops in the next Sprint.

- 28- The Product Owner Josh regularly joins the Daily Scrum and tries to bring some encouragement by cheering and congratulating with cakes each time a Developer moves an item into the done pile. What should a Scrum Master do? (choose 1)
  - Coach the team about the purpose of the Daily Scrum and that working software is the primary measure of success.

- 29- Developing new or revising existing technical documentation is a requirement of the team's Definition of Done. This is done to ensure that the product and/or its features can be maintained in the future. During the Sprint, the team's technical writer will be on holiday. What action should you take? (choose 1)
  -  The Scrum Team is still accountable to meeting the Definition of Done, the Developers should write the documentation, they are best placed to do so as the developers of the product.

- 30- Once born, who in the Scrum team can update or change an increment? (choose 1)
  - The Developers 

- 31- How do Timeboxes help a self-managing team? (choose the 2 best answers)

  -  Timeboxes encourage people to create the best possible result in the given time.

- 32- A key and very senior stakeholder directly asks a particular developer to add a piece of functionality to the sprint backlog now as an urgent task, is it disrespectful to refuse to add the functionality immediately? (choose 1)
  - No

- 33- During the Sprint Retrospective, the Product Owner raised a concern that the Developers only just met the Sprint Goal for the last Sprint. Developers think that the cause of the problem might be that some of them were working on other projects at the same time and that delayed the work. Which Scrum value were they not following? (choose 1)
  -  Focus

-  34- You join a team as the Scrum Master and notice it is currently one single team of 15 developers and a Product Owner, what should you do? (choose 1)
  -  Suggest the team split into teams of 10 or fewer, facilitate the discussion on how to split the teams up

- 35- Why might it benefit Empiricism to have shorter Sprints rather than longer Sprints? (choose all that apply):
  - Shorter feedback loops reduce the risk of deviating
  - Shorter Sprints minimizes further deviation by frequent inspecting and adapting
  - Shorter Sprints allow for more opportunities to inspect and adapt
  - Shorter Sprints mean more chances to adapt to changes in the environment

- 36- Who plans the work during the Sprint? (choose 1)
  - The Developers
 
- 37- During a Daily Scrum 2 developers disagree on a task and get into a heated argument, what are the best things a Scrum Master should do? (choose the 2 best answers)
  -  Help create the environment and space to discuss conflicts, find agreements in a productive and positive way. Remind the other members of the Scrum Team that conflicting ideas are natural, but making it personal does not help.
  -  Don't handle problems for the team. Instead, assist them in identifying and resolving issues on their own.

- 38- A highly respected and influential Developer often takes up a lot of time in the Daily Scrum by going off on tangents on things not so relative to the Sprint Goal. The Daily Scrum rarely finishes within 15 minutes. The other Developers dare not interrupt this Developer or ask him to stick to the topics in hand because the Developer is highly integral to the development of the product. As the Scrum Master has accountability to ensure the timebox is kept to 15 minutes, what should you do? (choose the best 2 answers)
  - You suggest coaching the Developers to help them find a way to solve the problem, bringing this up in the Sprint Retrospective at the latest and ask the team to find a solution.
  - You suggest privately asking them what they believe the key outcomes for the Daily Scrum are. Effectively coaching them to help create focus during the Daily Scrum.

- 39- The Product Owner is concerned about the slow progress of releases and thinks the Definition of Done should be reduced to speed up progress. As the Scrum Master what would you advise? (choose 4)
  - Reducing the Definition of Done will introduce technical debt such as unknown errors as functionality is added. The product might become more difficult to stabilize as work progresses. Development for future releases is likely to be slowed down in unpredictable ways.
  - Releasing the version with a reduced Definition of Done creates false assumptions about the actual state of the system and is risky. Fixes may need to be added post-release impacting user experience, reputation and development progress.
  - Ask the Developers and the Product Owner if they are still able to produce releasable Increments by altering the Definition of Done.
  - Ask the Developers and the Product Owner what problem they are trying to solve by reducing the Definition of Done. In what ways will this decision impact transparency and quality?

- 40- What is Scrum Based on? (choose 2)

  - At least one

- 42- By the end of the Sprint, a Product Backlog item in the Sprint Backlog does not meet the team's Definition of Done. What two things should happen with the item? (choose 2)
  - Do not include the item in the Increment for the Sprint.
  - Estimate the remaining work needed to make it "done" and add it to the Product Backlog for the Product Owner to decide what to do with it.

- 43- How often should the Scrum Team members change? (choose 1)
  - As needed, whilst taking into account a short-term reduction in productivity.

- 44- What is the maximum time allowed between the conclusion of one Sprint to the start of the next? (choose 1)
  - There is no time between Sprints

- 45- After a recent Sprint Review some of the stakeholders felt that the information presented was too fast and they didn’t get chance to go into the depth that they felt they needed to. The meeting had to finish because it ended at the end of the business day. The stakeholders ask the Scrum Master to hold a follow up Sprint Review and extend the future Sprint Reviews. What should the Scrum Master do? (choose 2)
  - Coach the stakeholders to understand Scrum and that all events are timeboxed and should not be extended, however they will discuss the timebox of the Sprint Review in the Sprint Retrospective and see if it can be extended for future Sprints. In the meantime help the Scrum Team to interact more with the stakeholders throughout the Sprint.
  - Coach the Developers with time management techniques and how to present the key information the Stakeholders need.

- 46- You are one of 3 Scrum teams working on a product and your Sprints are one month long. Changes have been made to the company’s technical infrastructure that will cause extended testing for your increment. You are unable to deliver the increment in time for the other Scrum Teams that rely on your contribution to their increment. Also, the CEO is extremely unsatisfied with your team’s velocity on in this sprint. As a Scrum Master is the best thing to do? (choose 1)
  - You suggest working with the other scrum teams on the ordering and the value of your open Product Backlog items to redefine the possible delivery date.

- 47- When it comes to completing all the items in the Sprint Backlog, all the Product Backlog Items added to the Sprint Backlog must be done by the end of the Sprint? (choose 1)
  - No
 
-  48- The Product Owner wants to know what each Developer is working on every day and insists that the developers send a report to her daily based on the information from the Daily Scrum. As the Scrum Master what should you do? (choose 1)
  - Coach the Product Owner and Developers on the purpose of Scrum Artifacts and Events and facilitate a discussion about their concerns and help them to find a solution to the root cause of the problem.

- 49- You have a choice of ways and locations to hold the Daily Scrum, how do you decide what option is best? (choose 1)
  - It should be held wherever the Developers think is best.

- 50- You are a Scrum Master of a 9 member Scrum Team; you haven't joined the Daily Scrum for some time because you thought it was running well. However, you join today and notice it took 20 minutes. The Developers often go over 15 minutes and they propose dividing the Scrum Team into two cohesive groups with their own Daily Scrum. What is your response? (choose 1)
  - You offer to join the Daily Scrum and teach them to keep the Daily Scrum within a 15-minute timebox.

- 51- At the moment, the engineering branch of your company is organized in siloed teams that specialize according to function (for example, design, front-end, back-end, database, and testing). What factors do you think are important to consider while transitioning from component teams to feature teams? (choose 2)
  -  Feature teams will require time to become productive as people from the different layers and components become accustomed to working and delivering unified functionality together as one Scrum Team.
  -  Productivity, in terms of lines of code or story points, will probably suffer during the transition, although even then delivery of business value is still likely to increase.

- 52- The product owner has used the Scrum team’s velocity to estimate delivery in 3 months. This is the reported delivery date to customers and stakeholders that desperately need the new functionality. However, at the last Sprint Review, it has been discovered that the current increment did not work! At the Sprint Retrospective, some developers admitted they have not been adhering to all elements of the Definition of Done. What is the most effective way to recover by the deadline? (choose 1)
  - The Developers inform the Product Owner that the progress she has perceived to date is not correct. The Increment is not releasable. They give a new estimate of the effort it would take to get the past work done, and suggest doing that work first before proceeding with new features. The Developers also re-estimate the effort to complete the remaining backlog, including all testing. In the end, it is Product Owner's call to continue the product or to cancel.

- 53- The Developers have realized that it does not possess the necessary tools and infrastructure to complete each of the items chosen from the Product Backlog. What action would you recommend as the Scrum Master? (choose 1)
  - Coach the Developers to improve its skills, tools and infrastructure over time and establish a Definition of “Done” that is actually possible to achieve given the current circumstances.

- 54- You have senior stakeholders that are very busy people. You invite them to the sprint reviews but they often do not attend. How does this affect empiricism and what might be the consequences? (choose 3)
  - Members who cannot attend the Sprint Review will have problems making product decisions
  - Key Stakeholders' feedback loop is too long risking high deviation

- 58- It's important that product development teams be cross-functional and comprised of people with a wide range of expertise to succeed. When implementing Scrum, what are the benefits of maintaining the existing component teams (for example, design, database, backend, and frontend)? (choose 1)
  - Because they have been working together for some time, there will be less initial disruption than a newly formed team. As they begin working, they will discover what works best and how to move towards cross-functional teams

- 59- You are finding that Daily Scrums always take more than 15 minutes due to one of the more experienced developers going into a lot of depth about his work and issues the team is facing. What should you do? (choose 2)
  - You remind the Developers that the Daily Scrum should take a maximum of 15 minutes and coach the Developers on how to be more efficient with their updates and that they can meet outside of the Daily Scrum to discuss what needs to be discussed.
  - You ask the experienced developer how he sees his impact on the Daily Scrum, effectively coaching him into work better as an equal team member.

- 60- Which of the below statements is true about the Sprint Goal? (choose all that apply)

  - Bring up the topic for discussion and allow the Developers to determine for themselves what to do as a self­ managing team.

- 64- What should you advise a Developer to do if he/she is approached by a key stakeholder and pressures the Developer to add a “very important” item to the current Sprint? (choose 1)
  - Inform the Product Owner so he/she can work with the person.

- 65- During the Sprint Review, the topic of budget was brought up and the project's budget may be cut owing to recent market developments. This causes the atmosphere to become tense, which in turn leads to disputes breaking out between people. What are the two most important things for the Scrum Master to do? (choose 2 best answers.)
  - Encourage the stakeholders and Product Owner to focus on delivering the highest-value items for the next Sprint.
  - Be objective and request for a short break for people to calm down.

- 66- As the Scrum Master what advice would you give to the Product Owner when ordering the Product Backlog? (choose 1)
  - Offer the Product Owner help in understanding that the goal of ordering the Product Backlog is to maximize the flow of value.

The board want to speed up development and have allocated more budget to bring in 2 new Scrum Teams to work on the product. What would be the biggest concern for the current Developers? (choose 1)
  - How to reduce dependencies between teams?

- 67- There is a new addition to the Developers, her name is Hilda. She is very creative and whilst developing she added new features to the increment that were not on the Product Backlog. This is discovered on the day of the Sprint Review. What should be done about these new features? (choose 2)
  - If possible, the Developers should remove the feature from the Increment before the Sprint Review
  - Discuss the Scrum Framework and reasons for the Product Backlog in the Sprint Retrospective

- 68- A sensitive data breach has occurred with the live product, this is a disaster for the product, the company and the users. Immediate changes have to be made including adding more security tests and functionality to the Definition of Done. What should the team do? (choose 2)
  - The additional security requirements are added to the Product Backlog and addressed by the Product Owner to prioritize.
  - During the Sprint Retrospective, the Developers assess how to add these additions to their Definition of Done so every future Increment will meet these security requirements.

- 69- When multiple Scrum Teams are working on the same Product it’s important that they all work on the same Product Backlog? (choose 1)
  - Tru
 
- 70- Anne is a Product Owner who needs to inform the board when the next release of a product is likely. With the Developers she considers the items in the Product Backlog needed to develop the Increment for the next release. Based on the team’s velocity she predicts the next release will be possible in 3 Sprints time. However the Developers admit to skipping some integration tests and believe that extra tests should be added to the Definition of Done before release. They believe it will take a further 10% of Sprint time to include these additional tests and believe that the release in 3 Sprints is still possible. What is the most effective way to recover? (choose 1)
  - The Developers inform Anne that the progress she has perceived to date is not correct. The Increment is not releasable. They give Anne their estimate of the effort it would take to get the past work done, and suggest doing that work first before proceeding with new features. The Developers also re-estimate the effort to complete the remaining backlog, including all integration tests. In the end, it is Anne’s call to continue the project or to cancel.

- 71- If the Product Owner asks your opinion as the Scrum Master as to who the most important stakeholder is, how would you respond? (choose 1)
  - The Product’s users

- 72- If the Technical Debt builds up, false assumptions about the present status of the Product and the Increment examined at Sprint Review might be made. (choose 1)

- 73-  At the eleventh Sprint Review, the stakeholders are very disappointed. They say the product so far will not meet their needs and is going to cost more than they budgeted for. What might have led to this? (choose the best 3 answers)
  - The stakeholders have not been using the Sprint Reviews to actively engage, and inspect and evaluate progress.
  - The Product Owner has not been interacting frequently with the stakeholders and kept them aware of the progress of the project.
  - The Scrum Master has not ensured transparency.

- 73- Are stakeholders only allowed to meet with the Scrum team at the Sprint Review? (choose 1)
  - No
- 74-  The Product Owner decides to release the current Increment to production. The stakeholders ask to stop “Sprinting” to react more quickly to the user feedback that is expected after this release. As the Scrum Master, what would you advise? (choose the best 2 answers)
  - Continue sprinting but shorten the Sprint length to allow for shorter feedback loops.
  - Continue sprinting and include the customer feedback in the Product Backlog.

- 75- The Product Owner is under pressure to release key features in 2 sprints time, ahead of competitors in the market and capitalising on this window of opportunity. The Developers do not think this is possible due to past reliance on external teams in the company that have been unreliable in the past. As the Scrum Master what do you suggest? (choose 1)
  - You propose working with the other team’s Developers to reduce dependencies and discuss reliability for this crucial release date.

- 76- It takes a few Sprints before a major stakeholder begins utilizing the product. The unsatisfied stakeholder contacts the Product Owner to express concerns about the unsatisfactory performance. The Product Owner seeks guidance from the Scrum Master. What would you recommend? (choose 1)
  - Encourage the Product Owner to bring the performance concerns to the Developers and work with them on how to improve performance, and ultimately have a stronger Definition of Done.

- 77- What things are best considered when deciding on the Sprint length? (choose 1)
  - The level of expertise over the technology to be used, ability to release an Increment to the end users, and the risk of being disconnected from the stakeholders.

- 78- During the Sprint, the Developers realizes they might not be able to finish all of the items in the Sprint Backlog. As the Scrum Master what would you suggest? (choose 1)
  - The Sprint length holds and the Developers continuously learn what is actually possible to do within the Sprint timebox.

- 79- What can you do to ensure the Developers understand the Product Backlog items discussed at Sprint Planning? (choose 1)
  - Request the Developers use some time during each Sprint to be involved in Backlog Refinement, helping the Product Owner decompose the items that are prioritised.

- 80- The Product Owner is under great pressure to release certain functionalities as soon as possible. To accelerate development, the Product Owner removes certain testing aspects temporarily from the Definition of Done. However, the Product Owner adds the missing testing to the Product Backlog to be done in the future. The Developers warn that this will increase technical debt. (choose the best 2 answer)
  -  Releasing with a reduced Definition of Done leads to incorrect assumptions about the product’s current condition. This is likely to cause unanticipated difficulties in future increments caused by not meeting the Definition of Done.
  -  Unknown issues will grow as work develops and functionality is added to the reduced Definition of Done. Stabilization of the system becomes increasingly challenging. Work on the current release and future releases will be slowed in unanticipated ways.

- 81- What is the relationship between technical debt and delivery? (choose all that apply.)
  -  Technical debt should be a concern of the Scrum Team.
  -  The more technical debt there is, the more difficult it is to maintain and add to the product.
  -  Developers are responsible for making technical debt transparent and sharing the true product status and risk with the Scrum Team.

  - Product Backlog items that can be done within one Sprint

- 83- At the Sprint Retrospective, you decide on 3 highly impactful changes to make. What should you do? (choose 2)
  - Add them to the Product Backlog
  - Address them as soon as possible

- 84- What is the relationship between velocity and technical debt? (choose 2)
  - When the Developers run into technical debt, the velocity will likely drop in the future.
  - Allowing technical debt for a few Sprints artificially increases the velocity.

- 85- What should the Developers do if whilst working they realize mid-sprint that development is more complex than they forecasted and they have chosen too much work to do after starting the Sprint? (choose 1)
  - Work with the Product Owner to remove some work or Product Backlog items as soon as possible, whilst considering the impact on the Sprint Goal.

- 86- Considering the Product Owner, which of the following will be a risk for the success of the Product Owner? (choose 1)
  - Sharing responsibilities with another Product Owner when overloaded.

- 87- Can the Sprint Backlog items be changed mid-sprint? (choose 1)
  - Yes
- 88-  You are 10 Sprints in and you observe that the Developers are hardly collaborating. Instead, the Developers are working in silos on their own tasks. You also notice that the items on the Sprint Backlog are mostly unrelated. You also notice that there isn’t a clearly defined Sprint Goal. The Product Owner and Developers inform you that due to the wide variety of items on their Product Backlog, creating a single Sprint Goal is not possible. What might explain why this Scrum Team is struggling to craft a Sprint Goal? (choose all that apply)
  -  Scrum might not be the best framework for the work done by this team.
  -  The Product Owner is not successfully communicating the Product Goal that they want to achieve.
  -  The Product Owner is not empowered to make decisions about items on the Product Backlog or their prioritisation.

- 89- A Project Manager would like to use Scrum for a new project and comes to you for advice. After explaining the Scrum Framework he expresses his intention to skip the Daily Scrums favouring weekly meetups as his employees already meet every day. What would you advise? (choose 1)
  - Daily Scrums eliminate the need for other meetings.

- 90- What is likely to happen if an organization only changed their current project terminology to fit Scrum without the proper understanding of Scrum as defined in the Scrum Guide? (choose all that apply)
  - Confusion will arise between those that understand Scrum and those that don’t.
  - The organization may not realize the real benefits of Scrum as there would be no real change on the way the teams work.
  - Organizations may feel less stressed as the behaviours would remain familiar to management.
  - Very little change will happen as Scrum is more than a set of terminology.

- 91- Your Scrum team has been working on a Product for 6 months. The product passes usability test and delivers an increment at the end of each Sprint, however it has not yet been released to real users. The stakeholders are putting a lot of pressure to release next month. The Product Owner does not think this is viable because the their is still a lot of work required before he has confidence in a release. He has a delivery date of 6 months and has been working towards that. What guidance or assistance can you provide by the Scrum Framework? (choose 3 answers.)
  - Challenge the Product Owner to validate if all the pending work is needed to release and how the number of features in a product release can be reduced.
  - Suggest the Product Owner meet with the team and rescope the scheduled work. Find out what can be released in one month to match the stakeholder's demands.
  - Encourage the Product Owner to interact with the Stakeholders to validate how much the current product satisfies their needs and the minimal things to add to release it.

- 92- How much time should be spent refining the Product Backlog? (choose 2)
  - The Scrum Team decides how and when refinement is done. The Product Backlog items can be updated at any time by the Product Owner or at the Product Owner’s discretion.
  - As much as the Scrum Team agrees is necessary to create enough ready Product Backlog Items.

# 07.07.2025 Scrum Master II: Exam Tips: Lesson 3
- Product Backlog: is an **emergent**, ordered list of what is needed to improve the product. it is the **sibgle source** of work undertaken by the Scrum Team.
- Product Backlog Items (PBIs) that can be Done by Scrum Team within **one Sprint** are deemed **ready** for selection in a Sprint Planning event. They usually acquire this degree of transparancy after refining activities. Product backlog refienement is the act of breaking down and further defiing Product Backlog items into smaller more precise items. This is an **ongoing activity** to add details such as a **decsription**, **order**, and **siza**. Attributes often vary with the domain of work.
- Nexus 3-9 Scrum Team for one Product
- Common Challange: Integration problems and depencencies on other teams and other increments.
- Nexus Integration Team: Product Owner, a Scrum Master, Nexus Integration Team Members
- Scrum ways reduces risk"
- Scrum employs an iterative, incremental approach to optimiye predictability and control risk.
- Scrum is founded on emprisicism which asserts that knowledge comes from experience and making decisions based on what is observed, (and not simply theorised).
- Scrum is founded on Lean thinking which reduces waste and focuses on the essentials
- regular inspection and adoption of the product the increment and the scrum team
- the Scrum Artifacts are transparent making the process visible to those doing the work as well as those receiving the work. 
- Scrum employs an iterative, incremental approach to optimiye predictability and to control risk. 
- Scrum is founded on empiricism which asserts that knowledge comes from experience and making decisions based on what is observed.
- **Agility Business Value** Evidence-Based Management (EBM) focouces on four** Key Value Areas (KVAs)**
  - Unrealized Value (UV)
    - what is the additional potential value that could be achieved? 
  - Ability to Innovate (A2I)
    - How effective is the organization at improving value? 
  - Current Value(CV)
    - what value is currently delivered by the organization? 
  - Time to Market(T2M)
    - How long does it take to deliver new value? 
-  Technical debt: a concept in programming that refelcts the extra development and testing work that arises when "Quick and Dirty" solutions result in later remediation.
- It creates an undesirable impact on the delivery of value and an avoidable increase in waste and risk. 
- **The six most common leadership styles are**
   - Authoritative Leadership: Impose expectations and define outcomes
   - Participative Leadership: Democratic and involving
   - Delegative Leadership: Instructing and empowering
   - Laissez-faire: Hands off and trusting
   - Transactional Leadership: Rewards and punish
   - Transformational Leadership: Inspires with vision and empowers
  
- A true Leader makes an effort to help develop the team so it can reach its full potential.
- It is leadership by helping others around you to grow.

- **Scrum Events**
  - Sprint Planning
  - Daily Standup
  - Sprint Review
  - Sprint Retrospective
- **Scrum Artifacts**
  - Product Backlog
  - Sprint Backlog
  - Increment
- **Commitments**
  - Product Backlog = Product Goal
  - Sprint Backlog = Sprint Goal
  - Increment  = DoD

- Scrum's artifacts represnt work or value. They are designed to maximiye transparancy of key information. Thus, everyone inspecting them has the same basis for adaption. 
- For the increamental, its commitment is the DoD , inspected at the Sprint Review
- For the Sprint Backlog, its commitment is the Sprint Goal, inspected at the Daily Scrum
- For the Product Backlog, its commitment is the Product Goal, inspected at Sprint Planning and the Sprint Review.
- The Product Backlog is an Emergent, ordered list of what is needed to improve the product. It is the single source of work undertaken by the Scrum Team.
- Product Backlog items that can be Done by the scrum team whithin one Sprint are deemed ready for selection in a Sprint Planning event.
- Product backlog refienment is the act of breaking down and further defining Product Backlog Items into smaller more precise items. This is an activity to add details, such as a decription, order, and size. Attributes often vary with the domain of work.
- When is the Sprint Goal crafted? The Sprint Goal is created during the Sprint Planning event and then added to the Sprint Backlog. 
- Who crafts the Sprint Goal?
- Can there be more than one Sprint Goal?
- Why is this Sprint Valuable?
- The Sprint Goal is the single objective for Sprint.
- As the developers work during the Sprint, they keep the Sprint goal in mind. If the work turns out to be different than they expected, they collaborate with the Product Owner to negotiate of the Sprint Backlog within the Sprint without affecting the Sprint Goal.
- An increment is a concrete stepping stone toward Goal. Each increment is additive to all prior increments and thoroughly verified, ensuring that all Increments work together. In order to provide value, the Increment must be usable. 
- **At least One** Incremental should be per each Sprint.
- Once born, **The Developers** in the Scrum Team can update or change an increment.
- DoD is a formal description of the state of the Increment when it meets the qualitz measures required for the product.
- **The best description of the DoD**:
  - It creates transparancy of the state of the Increment for inspection at the Sprint review
  - At Sprint Planning it guides the Developerswhen creating a forecasts for Items
  - It helps the Developers identify the work remaining for an Increment to be ready for release
- Scrum teams are cross-functional, meaning the members have all the skills necassary to create value each sprint. They are also self-managing, meaning they internally decide Who does What, When, and How.
- **Scrum Master manages the Process, not the People. the People manage themselves**
- Scrum Master does not dictate solutions. S/He recognizes problems and facilitates discussions so the team can decide on a solution.
# 06.07.2025 Scrum Master II: Exam Tips: Lesson 1
- **Scrum Master Pillars**
  - Transparency
  - Inspection
  - Adaption
- Scrum is founded on empiricism and lean thinking.
- Lean thinking reduces waste and focuses on the essentials. 
- **Empricism**
  - Making decision based on on what is observed
  - Knowlege comes from expirience
-  the impact of the Product Goal and Sprint Goal
-  the impact of timeboxing
-  the Empricical Scrum pillars of Transprancy, Inspection, and Adoptions
-  How artifactd help the transparancy
-  Achiving the Spring Goal is the best measure of success of Sprint
-  the Product backlog is an emergent process
-  **Scrum Values**:
  - Commitment
    - Product Backlog
      - Product Goal
    - Sprint Backlog
      - Sprint Goal
    - Increment
      - DoD 
  - Focus
  - Openness
  - Respect
  - Courage
- When these values are embodied by the scrum team and the people they work with, the Empricical Scrum pillars of Transparancy, Inspection and Adotion come to life building **TRUST**.
- **To build Trust**:
  - The Scrum Values
  - Emrirical Scrum Pillars
-  The Sprint Backlog commitment is to the Sprint Goal
-  Not to getting all work done from the Sprint Backlog!
-  Sometimes not all the work is needed to achieve the Sprint goal
- Scope may be clarified and renegoatiated with PO as more is learned.
- the Scrum Team should Respect
  - People
  - Diversity
  - Experience
  - Differeing points of view
  - Respect the accountabilities of the scrum team members 
- Trancparency is about seeing things clearly, the first step towards inspecting and adapting.
- Openness supports transparency, but is more about the interactions between individuals.  in other words, openness is more about how people interact. 
- Focus on the goal the Sprint Goal and Product Goal (Which is the creation of valuable product!). it is on achieving the product abd sprint goals not on velocity of work. 
- Courage is about communicating and being open about work and problems
- The 5 Stages of Team Development (Bruce Tuckman)
  - Forming
  - Storming
  - Norming
  - Performing
  - Adjourning
- Scrum Maste Responsibilities
  - Coaching the team members in self-management abd cross-functionality

  - How do you measure **solution delievery system**?
  - What metrics should we **collect**?
  - How do you **roll up** team measures to the **portfolio Levele**?
  - What metrics are **rihgt for you**?
  - Hoe do **Agile** and **traditional** metrics **fit together**?
  - What are the **Failur factors**?
  - How does this fit into your **overal governance strategy**?
- **The Stacey Matrix**:
- **The Cynefin Framework**

- Every Metrics has Strengthes & Weaknesses"
  - **Outcomes**: are **What the business wants or needs to achieve** as a result of the project.
    - They're the benefit your customers recieve from what your team produces the "**Why**"
    - This contrasts with outputs, which are products. services. profits, and revenue. the "**What**"
    - Outputs enables us to fund outcomes, but without outcomes, there is no need for outputs
   
  - **Outputs**: In a project, outputs are actions or deliverables that contribute to achieve the eventual outcome. Outputs are products, services, profits, and revenues. the "**What**"
    - This contrasts with outcomes, which create meanings, relationships, and differents. The "**Why**"
    - Outputs enables us to fund outcomes, but without outcomes, there is no need for outputs

- The Disiplined Agile Mindset
  - Delight customers
  - Be awesome
  - Context counts
  - Choice is good
  - Optimiye flow
  - Organize around products/service 

- Extrapolating the trend also allows us to **make leading, future looking decision.**
- **Metrics**:
  - Iteration Burndown
  - Release Burnup
  - Skill Level
  - Cumulative Flo Diagram
  - Velocity
  - Value Deliverd- Value Poinits
  - Net Promoter Score
  - Goal Question Metric (GQM)
  - Release Burndown
  - Defect Trends
  - Cost of delay
  - OKR
 
- **Green Shifting** is the gradual improvment of reported message as it proceed up the organiyation. The meaning changes and becomes less accurate at each level of reporting.
- Ex:
- **Worker**: We have several serious problems
- **Project Manager**: The team faces challenges
- **Middle Manager**: The team enjoy the challanges they face.
- **Director**: Everyone is having a great time

- **Watermelon Status Report**, the work appears to have a green status but on closer inspection is, in facet, red ...
- ... like a watermelon: Green on the outside and Red on the inside

- **Quantum Shifting** the status jumps from good to bad without warning


- **Team**:
  - Measure against team goals
  - Specefic metrics for each team
  - Metrics evolve as the situation evolves
  - Unique dashboard for each team

- **Program**:
  -  Measure against program goals
  -  Category indicators across multiple teams
  -  Program goals eveolve periodically
 
- **Portfolio**:
  - Measure against organiyation goals
  - Overall indicator or category indicators
  - Organiyational goals evolve slowly

# 13.05.2025 Agile Metrics: Measurment: Lesson 2
- Delivery Teams use a number of common metrics
  - **Spend Chart**:
    - Cost
    - Hours
    - Quantity
    - **PROS**: initutive/Gives Stakeholders the project status at a glance
    - **CONS**: It doesn't indicate whether the project is on schedule or producing a quality product.
   
  
  - **Burndown Chart**:
    - The charts shows the Tasks remaininh to complete for an Itration
    - When the read line meets the x-axis, all remaining work is completed
    - **PROS**: initutive/ Allows Stakeholders to quickly see the remaing tasks needed to complete an iteration
    - **CONS**: Don't account for changes such as new features, defects, or change requests. / Some people like to see charts trending upwards to indicate progress, growth.
   
  - **Burnout Chart**:
    - Shows the work the team has completed
      - **PROS**: Reflects changes in the project scope/ Easy way to show the team's progress over the duration of the project
      - **CONS**: Only shows scope and prohgress of the project/ Excludes other important factors, such as spend, quality and customer satisfaction.

  - **Cumulative Flow**:
    - Shows how much work is in each Stage of the workflow for a given time
      - **PROS**: Provide quick overview of team's progress / Can show blockages and trends that can signal risk to meeting delivery date.
      - **CONS**: Because the chart displays work in multiple states, it can be harder to interpret than a burnup or burndown chart


- What metrics, if any, do you currentls use to track team **Progress**?
  - Velocity
  - Throughput 
- What about to track team **Engagement**?
  -Niko-Niko Calender
  Net Promoter Score (NPS)

- **Why Measurment**:
- Lagging Metrics - Profit Items Delivers
- Leading Metrics - Trends Impacts of Projections  

- Not everything that can be counted counts, and not everything that counts can be counted.
- Use metrics **that produce meaningful results**, such as satisfied customers and value delivered.
- What metrics produce meaningful results?
  - Simple and self-generating
  - Relevant to the end goal of the project
  - Focused on leading indicators 

- Traditional Metrics
  - **Hours Worked**: Tracking **hours worked** can trigger the **Hawthorne Effects**, leading to
    - Long hours
    - Burn-out
    - Defects
    - Consumed budgets
  -  **Line of code Writen**:
    -  Tracking lines of code written does not rewards simplificiation and **can lead to code bloat.** 
  - **Budget Consumed**:
    - Measuring budget consumed leads to more budget consumed, which is noot the true goal of the project is delighted customers and value delivered, not spent funds
  - **Conformance to plan**:  Plans are often created at the beggining of project- when we know the least about the project or its stakeholders / Tracking conformance to a plan may be tracking progress against a faulty map
 
- **Metrics Measurment**:
  - **Feature Acceptance**: are used to determine whether the implementation is correct and delivers the business benefits / counts the number of features that have met these criteria
  - **Parking Lot Diagram**: This is Easy to produce with an Agile reporting tool. It **summarizes the status of the project in one single view**.
  - **Sponsor Confidence**:
  - **User Satisfaction**:
  - **Defect Cycle Times**: 

- Level of Reporting and guidance
- **Team Level**: Tracking and reporting focus on Local measures and issues relating to the product or service the team is working on.
- **Program Level**: is concerned with how progress, changes and issues interact with other related or dependent initiatives. Metrics at this level have more of a strategic steering function to help ensure work is coordinated and aligmed.
- **Portfolio Level**: Tracking and reporting focus more on the strategiec direction and realiying the benefits of the workstreams. here metrics are used answer questions such as : Are we getting the intended outcomes? Have any market changes or internal strategy decisions been impacted? Will we still get out our intended result? Where should we invest next?

- How agile metrics are used for tracking and forecasting?
- Goals and risks of measurement
- What you should be measureing and why?
- Metrics options and trade-offs
- Rolling up metrics to the program level
- How to create dashboard
- **What is Agile?**
- A process for discovering requirments and developing solutions, Agile encourage self-organizing and cross-functional teams working in collaborations with their customer/and user(s).
- It promotes adaptive planning, incremental development, early delivery, and continous improvment to build products and services while remaining flixible to change.
- **What is Lean?**
- Lean is an approach that produces value for customers quickly through a focus on reducing delays and eliminating waste which results in increased quality and lower cost.
- **What is Decipline Agile?**
- Decipline Agile is hybrid of world's leading practices and methodes that provides straightforward guidance to enable you to choose your Way of Working (WoW).
- It's a people-first hybrid toolkit that will enable you to effectively combine strategies from Scrum, Agile Modeing (AM), Extreme Programming (XP), Kanban, SAFe, PMBoK, and many other approaches, so you can tailor and scale based on the situation you face.

- **What are metrics?**
- Metrics are indicators that help track a project's performance. Metrics are helpful to evalaute project status to see if we are on track and give indicators of possible risks or issues. Metrics are also helpful ro steer project back on track in case problem occur.

- **What are Agile Metrics?**
- Agile metrics are metrics that related to agile projects. Also, since agile projects can change quickly, agile metrics must also be quickly to generae, and analyze or else they risk begin out of date before they are consumed.
- **Why are metrics are important?**
- Projects are often long, costly endeavors. We have a responsibility to track progress to help assess and steer the project as well as share updtes, progress and issues with sponsors and other interested stakeholders.
- Projects are like Joirney.
- Food Delivey Journey: Sometimes the destination and routs are very familiar and we can track out our progress using  familiar way points
- Sometimes we are on the route thet we are not used before and there are more uncertaincy.
- To be successful we need **clear vision**, **direction** and **way of tracking the progress** and taking corective actions as neccassary. Metrics provide way to evalaue progress and it will be helpful cast outcomes such as **shedule** and **cost**.
- Metrics also rack and give feedback on subjective metrics such as **confidence** or **team health**.

# 15.04.2025 Agile Coach: Basics of Disciplined Agile: Lesson 1
- **Lean Life Cycle**: the Lean Life cycle enables team to plan continously and just in Time (JIT). It allows them to keep a work item list containing the different types of work they carry out, along with the work's associated policies, like importance, turnaround time, etc.
- The **Lean life cycles** is often more difficult to adopt for teams new to agile and lean. It requires a more mature team to follow fewer rules and still make significant changes to the way they work.
- Exploratory life cycle: The Exploratory life cycle focused on reducing risk and unnecessary cost when developing a new product or feature. It involves running various customer-facing experiments to determine what potential customers want, based on actual usage. This lead to better product design and decreases the likehood of having to fix problems or redesign the product later on.

# 24.03.2025 Agile Coach: Feedback: Lesson 1
- Feedback, however, is a tool. It's a process that will help you to get better at what you do, continue doing what you are already good at, and build better relationships.
- Gather Feedback
   -  It could be people that you trust and have a great relationship with,
   -  Important stakeholders who you need to build strong relationships with to move forward in your career or achieve important goals
   -  You might want to ask people you admire who have a skill that you want to develop.
   -  You might even want to ask people who you have a difficult relationship with, so you can figure out ways to build a stronger connection.
- So how do you ask for feedback? Ask for it in a specific area.
- Consider how the of feedback delivery be deliverd.
- When you receive feedback, always be gracious and grateful, whether you agree with the feedback or not.
- Ask multiple people for feedback.
- Look for indirect feedback
- Be Objective
- **Feedback Facts**
   - It helps you improve
   - You'll make mistake
   - You won't always like it or agree with it
   - You can choose how to interpret and use it
- Productive Feedback> Specefic, useful, and delivered with the intention of helping you to develop or improve.
- Unproductive Feedback> General, unhelpful, or delivered without positive intent

- **how you respond to and react to feedback, even if the feedback isn't what you want to hear**
   - Take your time to process the information
   - Don't fixate on negative feedback or positive for that matter.
   - Separate opinion and fact
   - Focus on the facts, and train yourself to take opinions on board
- First, you want to decide what you'll take from the feedback?
- Second, set yourself a goal. What exactly do you want to achieve from your feedback?
- Third, consider how you will achieve your goal. 
- Finally, how will you measure progress? 

- **Providing Feedback**
   - First, prepare. When preparing, think about key messages you'll share. Also think about how you will deliver the feedback.
   - Second, tailor your communication for each individual. Consider how others best receive information.
   - The third step is to focus on your tone.
   - The fourth step is to explore the facts and use concrete examples.
   - The fifth step is to listen well.
- Delivering feedback should be a collaborative process, so leave time for the other person to digest information.
- Informal feedback: It's **advice** and **suggestions** about what you could do to move forward, and usually it's **unplanned**.
- The trick is to **make informal feedback part of everyday conversation**. Real-time feedback helps your team to make continuous small improvements.
- Keep your feedback positive, focusing on suggestions for improvements.
- Focus on your intention rather than the exact words you're going to use.
- Keep your tone informal and approachable.
- Try not to provide feedback based on personal judgments about the other person.
- The crucial part is putting this into practice, and the easiest way to do this is to create a habit.
- Provide feedback to one person today. It could be positive or developmental.

- **Scenario**
   - A colleague (AI) is struggling to prepare for a presentation. Provide empathetic feedback to help improve their presentation skills.
- **Goals**
   - Ask what areas they would like feedback on.
   - Give concrete suggestions on how to improve.
   - Use supportive language to encourage self-reflection and confidence.
- **Strengths**
   - Empathy and Emotional Intelligence: Good job showing empathy by asking how Sam is doing and expressing willingness to help.
   Specificity and Clarity of Feedback: Provided clear and specific areas for improvement, such as avoiding too much text in the presentation and engaging with the audience.
   - Actionability of Feedback: Offered practical and actionable suggestions, like starting the presentation with an exciting question and projecting confidence.
   - Encouragement: Maintained a supportive tone throughout the conversation, which is important for someone sensitive to criticism.
- **Areas of improvement**
   - Expectation Setting to Start the Meeting: Could have set clearer goals or objectives for the conversation at the beginning to align the interaction.
   - Active Listening and Open Communication: There were moments where responses seemed hesitant or repetitive, which could be improved for smoother communication.
   - Handling Defensiveness: While the conversation was supportive, there could be more focus on managing potential defensiveness by acknowledging feelings more explicitly.

- Start by getting clear on the specifics of **where** and **how** you are going to deliver feedback for each person or group
- Then, for each group, determine **how often** you'll be providing feedback and add the delivery of the feedback into your diary well in advance.
- How you'll ask the other person to join you for feedback.
- Then consider how you'll prepare for the feedback.
- Regardless of how long you spend preparing, remember, **be clear on your intention**.
# 23.03.2025 Agile Coach: Games: Lesson 1
   - **Metertab**
   - **Ball Point Game**: Learning agility through play
      -  What you need
         - A large room in which students can move around easily
         - One ball per team
         - Stopwatch or cell phone
         - One table per team with the columns passes, estimate and business
         - 6-8 players per team (equal-sized groups)
         - Player
- What is really important is that you stick to these three points
   - Plan how we want to proceed & We estimate how many points we will achieve
   - Then we play
   - Then we look at what we're doing.
   - And through the game you will learn what scrum is in short
   - Duration: 30 min
- How do you get points now?
   - You have one, two, or three balls; you can decide for yourself, depending on how comfortable you feel.
   - The ball must be touched by every person on the team.
   - The ball has airtime. It cannot be on the ground or any other surface, including the table. If it falls, it's a mistake; it doesn't give you a point. It's not that tragic, exactly. It cannot be given to the next person right next to you; someone has to be in between. Everything that isn't stated here, i.e., we have to stand in a line or something else, you can organize yourself. You decide how.
- Rules
   - Everyone in the room should participate, but participation is voluntary. If someone doesn't want to play, they could take on the role of timekeeper, for example.
   - Start = Finish: The person who brings the ball into the circle must also be the last to touch it.
   - Each team member must touch each ball in the system at least once.
   - Balls may not be passed to their immediate neighbors.
   - When handed over, the ball must be in the air for a recognizable amount of time (airtime).
   - Balls that fall to the ground do not score points.
   - Each ball that has passed completely through the team once and has been touched by everyone counts.
- Goal
   - The team should transport as many balls as possible in each round.
- Tip:
   - Young players should avoid talking during the game if possible (for greater concentration).
- You now have one minute to think about what has held you back and what you can improve from now on.
- GAME PROCESS:
   - 2-minute introduction
   - 2-minute explanation of the rules before the first round
   - 5 rounds - per round:
   - 1 minute preparation for the teams: tactics and estimation - how many balls will we get through
   - 1 minute playing
   - 1 minute recording results & review
   - 10-15 minute debriefing after the last round: How did you experience the ball game? What held you back, what helped you progress?
   - Tip for moderators: Push the teams to improve, for example, by suggesting that 10 times the performance is possible. This increases the likelihood of not just optimizing small details, but thinking big.
- Reflection
   - It's important that you reflect on the game with the group after the game to reinforce the transfer.
   - The benefits of Scrum that led to the improvement are usually the ones that emerge. Scrum's values (focus, openness, commitment, courage, respect) are also frequently mentioned
- Ball Point Game - Learn Agility in a Playful Way
   - WHY AM I DOING THIS GAME?
      - Quickly grasp Scrum processes in a playful way
      - The benefits of Scrum are immediately apparent (failure quickly, lots of trial and error, personal responsibility, self-organization, teamwork, sprints, reflection, improvement through feedback, short planning time)
      - Realization that review and reflection are essential for improvement (review should therefore never be omitted!)
Easy transfer of the game's processes to the classroom process during a project!

   - **Decider Poker**
      -  Ever found yourself stuck in endless debates over who should make a decision? Spent hours arguing about something that doesn’t even impact you directly? Felt frustrated when too many people are involved in a decision-making process?
      -  Inspired by the insights and great discussions at Meetup by **Baptiste Grand, Head of Agile in XITASO GmbH** and I learn this new game under **Decider Poker** name💎🛠️💎🛠️
   - This approach helps you quickly determine who truly needs to be involved in a decision and the level of interaction required. Once you have this clarity, you can apply structured decision-making techniques like the **Advice Process** or **Systemic Consensus**.
   - **How does it work?**
      - 1️⃣ Gather the participants.
      - 2️⃣ Each person secretly selects their "Decider Level."
      - 3️⃣ Reveal all choices simultaneously.
      - 4️⃣ Discuss and refine as needed.

- This method is **simple**, **non-intrusive**, and **flexible**—it doesn’t require special cards or templates, works both **in-person** and **remotely**, and fits **Agile and traditional** settings alike.

# 23.07.2024 Agile Team in the Age of AI: Lesson 1: challenges
- Four major challenges with their product development.
   - The first was that the project's requirements were not well understood before the work began.
   - The second was that the users only know what they want after they see the software.
   - The third is that requirements almost always change during development.
   - Finally, they found that newer technologies made their strategies unpredictable. 
- To deal with these problems, the manager at Chrysler invented something called extreme programming, while the manager at the other company created the Scrum framework.
- Then it balanced those against an anti-value or something they were trying to avoid on the right. Then they scratched out these four values and their anti-values on the whiteboard. They were
   - individuals and interactions over processes and tools,
   - working software over comprehensive documentation,
   - customer collaboration over contract negotiation,
   - responding to change over following a plan.
-  The Agile Manifesto begins with the words, "We are discovering improved methods for software development."
-  Artificial intelligence will likely be one of the biggest achievements in the last few centuries. It will have an impact on almost every part of the world. AI will likely change many jobs and hopefully create many new jobs. The Agile mindset is a terrific way to work, but it'll have much less of a long-term impact. The best way to think of Agile is like a fly on the back of an AI elephant.
-  AI will cause this level of Agile shake up. So Agile needs to shake up with it. In the next part, you're going to start seeing the impact AI will have on Agile teams. Some of these changes will happen immediately, while others might happen over time. It's like that old Danish saying that it's not easy to make predictions, especially about the future.
- In the past, Scrum teams have always separated the **what** from the **how**. This is what the customer wants and how it will be delivered. But now, AI teams will balance **what the customer wants** and **why it's happening**. So user stories become questions on figuring out the what and the why. When data creates your product, then software development is much less important. In fact, once you have the data, AI tools will generate most of the software. When that happens, an Agile team is much less about development and much more about increasing organizational knowledge. These teams will be much less focused on how and much more focused on why.
- The ScrumDataMaster focuses on removing obstacles and sharing team insights across the organization.
-  the ScrumDataMaster needs to democratize the system. They'll need to make sure that the stores can use this new system. Plus, they'll have to find a way to get feedback from the stores if the system's not working correctly. This new ScrumDataMaster will also be in charge of removing obstacles. If the research lead can't access the data sources, the ScrumDataMaster will help the team get the data they need. If you've worked on a data product, then you know that this is one of the largest impediments to training the system. This role will also help with some of the updated events. There'll be newer brainstorming meetings to help the data scientists come up with interesting questions. They'll also still be meetings for the team to reflect down on ways they can improve their work.
-  The ScrumDataMaster will help the team transition to working on intelligence systems that rely on data. At first, there'll be uncertainty, but new ideas will emerge as AI systems overtake product development.
-  Some of the clues you'll see on your team when they're burned out. First is that **quality goes down**. You'll begin to see that your team's defect numbers are going up. This is usually because the team is tired. Second is that your **team members are becoming cranky and short with each other**. Working too hard for too long is bound to make anyone short-tempered. And the third clue is that your **team members start complaining**.
-  **Solutions**:
   - You can suggest that one sprint per release, the team only commits to half their velocity. They can use the other portion of their normal velocity for whatever they choose. I call these **walking sprints**.  That means each individual gets to decide how they want to handle the extra time in the sprint. They can work on techdat or self-learning, or experiments that will help produce better designs. The important thing is to give them the breathing room they clearly need.
   - Another option is to tie these walking sprints to national holidays or planned time off
-  In fact, one of the agile principles says that the best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self organizing teams.
-  How does a scrum team make sure they stay in alignment with the bigger picture?
-  The architectural constraints. These come in the form of **nonfunctional requirements** or **NFRs**.  These NFRs are things like **response times**, **coding languages**, and **server specifications**. 
-  Make sure this group is represented in your sprint reviews. You can also include them in design sessions. In fact, the release boundaries are a great time to hold informal reviews with them.
-   Agile architecture is emergent, meaning that teams are defining the design locally. At the same time, they are intentional, meaning that all stakeholders, including architects, are consulted. Their requirements are also solicited to ensure that teams' intentions match the enterprise intention.
-   **Sprint Zero**: The goal here is to solidify the product vision, assemble the team, and setup the environment they need to succeed. = One of the principles states we should build our teams around motivated individuals, give them the environment and support they need. That's exactly what I do in my sprint zeros.
-   **Estimate Inflation**: It can be mistaken for greater value delivery.
   - First is Mike Cohn's triangulation method. In this case, the story being estimated will be compared to two prior backlog items the team has completed. One of the done stories will be larger than this one, and the other will be smaller. For example, if the team is negotiating whether a story should be a three or a five point story, you'll ask them to compare this story to a one or two they've already completed. You'll also find an eight or 13 point story they finished before. By comparing the current story against two others, you'll get an estimate that's in alignment with their previous estimates.
   - Next, you can pull out your baseline story from when your team first began. When you did your initial estimates with the team, you found a relatively small story in the backlog that everyone agreed was about a two. You called that story a two, and it became your baseline.
- **Preventing Overcommitment**:
   - First, make sure that every story is fully understood by everyone. Make sure each story is fully reviewed in Sprint planning.
   - Second, make sure your stories are ready to be included in the Sprint.
   - Third, start every Sprint planning event with an open dialogue about team members' availability for the Sprint.
   - Fourth, focus on the capacity for work in progress, or WIP, during Sprint execution.
   - Last, Fourth, focus on the capacity for work in progress, or WIP, during Sprint execution.   

# 06.08.2023 Agile Software Development: Lesson 3: External Customer Guidance
- Start by understanding how external customers are currently being engaged.
- While there's no standard playbook across all industries for customer engagement, some elements are needed universally. Start by understanding your company's current strategies in the areas of opportunity assessment and solution exploration.
- In the area of opportunity assessment, it will be helpful for IT to understand the process being used to **identify new products**  or **identify new feature** or **Solution Exploration** or **product enhancements**.
- Opportunity Assessment
 - Identify new products and enhancements
 - Ensure external customers are part of the process
- Some techniques you can suggest to your product partners are things like **social media engagement**, **webinars** to help your customers use your products, and **ask for volunteers to help solve some problem** or **design a new product**.
- Solution Expöoration
 - Assess feasibility before project begins
 - Share risk between IT and product
- The goal is to experiment with prototypes that will prove or disprove the feasibility of the opportunity idea. Make sure you have customer feedback on prototypes. This can ensure value in the market as well.
- At this point, you've effectively shared the risk between IT and product and done so in a cost and time effective manner. You're investing less upfront in order to justify greater expenditure later. As an IT leader, engaging your external customers usually involves other departments in your organization. Use your influence and these steps to create a customer-focused organization.   
# 06.08.2023 Agile Software Development: Lesson 2: Internal Customer Engagement
- Identifying your key customer groups and understanding how your transformation will affect them
 - A simple technique to use in i**dentifying your stakeholders is to look at data related to development and support requests**.
 - The goal here is to understand who the heaviest users of your IT services are.What's important is knowing their department or area, and getting a rough count of how many projects or services have been provided. In other words, undestand Request History.
# 06.08.2023 Agile Software Development: Lesson 1: Transformation Your Organization
- There are several approaches you can take for your transformation. However, there are critical steps that must be accomplished no matter which approach you choose. If you miss one or more of these steps, you'll face challenges in your transformation.
 - First, you must have a vision for what you're transforming and why.
 - Next, you need to create a team of individuals who believe in your vision and are dedicated to getting the organization to the place you envision.
 - Next, with this core group, you will build a roadmap for your transformation.
  - who will be affected by the transformation you're planning?
  - Are these changes restricted to IT-only projects?
  - Will your business partners be affected?
   -  Understand your customers and look for partnerships
 - Examine how your existing portfolio will need to change.
  - Portfolio  
   - Portfolio: Lightweight intake
   - Simplyfy tracking
  - Practices
   - Guardrails
   - Consistent
   - Frameworks 
  - Mangement
   - New role definition
   - Clear expectations
 - You'll need to tackle your overall IT organizational structure.
  - will the hierarchy change, and will the reporting and team structures be altered?
  - Make sure you're addressing the technical foundations throughout your transformation.
  - You'll need to transform your metrics so you have visibility of your projects, as well as the health of your transformation.
# 12.02.2023 Public Speaking Foundations: Lesson 15: Get Feedback
- There are two indicators of a helpful review: **truthfulness** and **specificity**.
- Indicator of worthwhile feedback:
 - Truthfulness
 - Specificity 
# 12.02.2023 Public Speaking Foundations: Lesson 14: Explore strong ways to close
- Five different **closing** techniques
 - First, the speaker might choose a simple title close. In this approach the presenter restates or reframes the title.
 - Second, the speaker might choose to close with a short summary of the speech.
 - Third, a speaker can try closing with a quote. An effective closing quotation summarizes the main thrust of a presentation. Imagine closing "One Team, One Dream" speech with something like this.
 - Fourth, ending with a personal tagline can be effective if you often present to the same audience.
 - Lastly, a speaker can try closing with a call to action. In the call to action close you'll tell the audience what to do as well as when and how to do it.
# 12.02.2023 Public Speaking Foundations: Lesson 13: Handle Q&A
- If you're planning a question and answer portion of your presentation, keep these two tips in mind:
 - One, start by letting your audience know how you'll handle your Q&A.
 - Second, hold your Q&A session near the end, but not at the end. 
 - This near the end (Q&A), not at the end approach, it does two things:
  - Number one, in the unlikely event that no one has any questions for you, you can smoothly pivot to your closing statement. The last words the audience hears needs to be your voice and your wrap-up message.
  - 
# 12.02.2023 Public Speaking Foundations: Lesson 12: Use props and visual aids
- There are three great reasons why you might wanna use a prop:
 - The number one reason is **demonstration**. For most demos, showing is far more effective than telling.
 - The second reason you might wanna use a prop is to provide a **concrete metaphor** for an abstract concept.
 - The third reason you might wanna use a prop is for **dramatic effect**.
 - As you work with your props, keep three important tips in mind. 
  - Number one, rehearse with your prop.
  - Number two, remember, every slide in your presentation, it's actually a prop.
  - Number three, the way you present your prop can enhance its overall effectiveness. 
  - 
# 12.02.2023 Public Speaking Foundations: Lesson 11: Practice great body language
- **Emotionally connect** with the words you're saying, your body naturally knows what to do.
- Develop professional body language:
 - First, warm up your body before you speak.
 - Second, when you hit the stage, you definitely don't want to keep this power pose posture.
 - Third, avoid doing anything with your body that's distracting.
 - Fourth, whether you're a novice presenter or a seasoned pro, record and watch your rehearsals or performance.
 - Fifth, write content you believe. Authentic body language tends to flow from great content.
# 12.02.2023 Public Speaking Foundations: Lesson 10: Reduce the use of crutch words
- speak with more clarity:
 - First, review a recording of yourself talking. Make a point of listening for filler words ( Awareness of my specific problem is the first step to getting it under control.)
 - Use **Pause technique** to collect yourself. 
# 12.02.2023 Public Speaking Foundations: Lesson 9: Develop vocal variety
- Volume, tone, and pace, these are three key areas for you to practice your vocal variety.
 - The most fundamental way to gain anyone's attention is to break a pattern.
 - The second key area to consider for vocal variety is in your emotional tone.
 - The third key area is with your pace.
# 12.02.2023 Public Speaking Foundations: Lesson 8: Avoid common opening mistakes
- Common Opening Mistakes
 - Starting with something trite
 - Clearing your throat
 - Highliting technical insecurities
 - Bad practice is to draw attention to your own personal insecurities. 
# 12.02.2023 Public Speaking Foundations: Lesson 7: Introduce your agenda
- Agenda usually includes the **purpose of the presentation**, **what will be discussed**, **who will be participating**, and **how long your presentation will last**. 
- During your presentation, it's a good idea to briefly remind your audience about where you're going with your speech. This is called the **Teaser** approach.
- The goal of a teaser isn't to lay out your entire program. Instead, you set expectations and build interest in only one to three upcoming agenda items.
- **Teaser** approach: You do this by giving the audience only a tiny bit of information that makes them want to know more.
# 12.02.2023 Public Speaking Foundations: Lesson 6: Explore five strong openings
- How can you use your words to grab the attention of your audience right away? Five techniques that exploit the power of what's called the cold open
 - Number one, I often like to start with a presentation by asking an open-ended question.
 - Second, you can effectively start a presentation with a story that illustrates a key point of your presentation.
  -  Number one, people really perk up and pay attention whenever someone mentions a story. 
  -  Further, a well-told story often creates that sense of mystery.
 - Third, you can start your presentation with a bold statement.
 - Fourth, tell your audience to imagine something.
 - Fifth, you can start with hard evidence, usually in the form of a quote or a documented fact.
# 12.02.2023 Public Speaking Foundations: Lesson 5: Develop credibility
- How do you develop personal credibility quickly? **confidence** and **competence**
- confidence 
 - First, dress to inspire confidence. 
 - Second, use nonverbal skills to build confidence.
 - Third, sound confident.
- Your look, your nonverbals, and your vocal quality are three ways to quickly demonstrate confidence, but to develop personal credibility, you're also going to have to demonstrate competence. 
-   
# 12.02.2023 Public Speaking Foundations: Lesson 4: Rehearse
- First, make sure your rehearsal is as close to the real thing as you can get. 
- Second, remember they don't call it dress rehearsal for nothing.
- Third, get an audience for your rehearsal. Ideally, rehearse your presentation with people in the room.
- Fourth, record yourself on video during your rehearsal. Play it back and watch for areas where you do well and look for areas where you can improve.
- Fifth, listen to yourself. I like recording my speech and putting it on a portable device then I'll listen to it while taking a walk or exercising. 
- Sixth, rehearse in real time. If you're giving a one hour presentation, record a one hour video of yourself, not five minutes here, 10 minutes there.
- And finally, rehearse at the same time you'll give your presentation. 
# 12.02.2023 Public Speaking Foundations: Lesson 3: Warm up
- three quick vocal warm-ups for early **morning** presentations:
 - Number one, get up early and get moving.
 - Two, avoid cold drinks. Remember, you want to warm up, not cool down
 - Three, make sure to use your voice before you deliver your speech.
- If you're presenting in the late **afternoon** or evening keep two vocal basics in mind.
 - Number one, save your voice. Talk, sing, or hum a little throughout the day to keep your voice warm, but try not to talk too much during the day.
 - Two, room temperature water is still your best friend. Avoid drinking more caffeine than normal.
 - Avoid cold beverages, especially carbonated ones.
 - If you have a solitary job where you don't speak or interact with others for hours at a time try warming up your face before you talk.
 - Stretching your face muscles lets you display emotional range. One facial warm-up I like to do is brutally ugly. It's called small as a raisin, big as a pumpkin.
 - And because it's so ugly I do it privately. I wrinkle my face to try to make it as small as I can, as small as a raisin, and then I stretch my face to make it as large as I can, think of that open mouth, bulging eyes of a jack o'lantern. I'll go back and forth from small to large to warm up my face and emotional range. 
 - Finally, warm up your body before you speak. Before you present go somewhere private and try striking a few over the top, widely expansive postures.
# 12.02.2023 Public Speaking Foundations: Lesson 2: Outline your speech
-  four different types of outlines. **Descriptive**, **problem/solution**, **chronological**, and **regional**.
-  In a **descriptive** presentation, you break down your topic into key informational categories. This can be a great choice for informational presentations.
-  This type of outline (**problem/solution**) focuses first on audience pain points then pivots to easing the pain. The problem/solution outline is a great choice for many persuasive presentations. 
-  A **chronological** outline either goes forward or backward in time. This can be a great choice for informational presentations. The chronological approach can also be a good choice for an inspirational address. If you're using a motivational story as the basis of an address, use the chronological what happens next approach, to make sure you cover all the major plot points.  
- **Regional** is frequently used for informational presentations as well.
# 12.02.2023 Public Speaking Foundations: Lesson 1: Know why you're talking
- audience will be falls into one of three main categories. You'll want to **persuade**, **inform**, or **inspire** your audience.
- In a **persuasive presentation**, your aim is to change audience behavior.
- But in an **informational presentation**, your main purpose is to educate.
- In an **inspirational** or entertaining presentation, you'll want to emotionally move your audience.
# 05.02.2023 Agile Foundations: Start an agile transformation
- With any large organizational change, it's difficult to see where to start. 
 - Up to Bottom
  - Starting from the top down could get you a lot of executive support, but the teams might not know much about the agile mindset
 - Bottom to Up
  -  Starting from the bottom up will get you going pretty quickly, but you might run into trouble with executive support. 
 - You might be surprised to hear that a lot of agile transformations fail before they even get started. That's because a lot of organizations have a **culture** which has a hard time embracing big changes.
 - An organizational culture is an unseen and unspoken way of working. 
 - One of the most common types of organizational culture is the **control culture**.
 - This is a culture that's based on a hierarchy of different supervisors, directors, and executives. Everyone in these organizations knows exactly who they work for and knows who works for them.
# 05.02.2023 Agile Foundations: Major agile challenges
- Biggest challenge in large organizations is underestimating how radical this transformation can be.
- If you want to embrace a more agile mindset, then you have to change your whole relationship with uncertainty.
- Eliminating handoffs
- Working Software as status updates 
# 05.02.2023 Agile Foundations: Planning Poker
 - This is a consensus building technique that was adapted from a group decision-making tool called **Wideband Delphi**.
 -  Planning poker helps groups of people estimate how much effort it would take for the whole team to finish a user story.
 -  It's a way to get a shared understanding about all the development and design challenges to deliver that small batch of work.
# 05.02.2023 Agile Foundations: Combat groupthink
 - Agile Value: One of the most important ideas in the Agile Manifesto is that teams should favor **individuals** and **interactions** over **processes** and **tools**.
 - Everyone on an Agile team should always be **teaching** and **learning**.
 - They could end up doing something called groupthink. That's when a few experts make a convincing argument and the rest of the team just follows along. 
# 05.02.2023 Agile Foundations: Scrum Master
- SM closer to being a trainer or a coach.
- They can even be an administrator.
- Scrum Master as both a **bulldozer** and a **shield**. They bulldoze through **obstacles**, but they also **protect the team from outside interference**. These obstacles can be **contacting someone**, **setting up meetings** or even **ordering software**. 
-  The Scrum Master might not have the authority to stop the manager, but they can let them know how their actions will interfere with the product delivery. This type of confrontation can be very political, so the Scrum Master should be able to manage conflict. They might just call them a **servant leader** or an **Agile coach**.
# 05.02.2023 Agile Foundations: Improve Customer Collaboration
  - Dangers of Equaing Agile and traditional Roles
   -  This way of thinking can lead to a lot of problems. For one, it can move people into these roles when they may not be the best fit. 
   -  And two, it plays into a stereotype that organizational changes are always step-by-step.
  - Agile mindset is a big change and radically different from how most organizations operate.
  -  A Scrum Master is a completely different role. Here you'll act as a coach. Instead of having authority over the team, you'll be encouraging them to take on greater responsibilities. Remember that Agile teams are cross-functional and self-organized. So instead of being a manager, you don't want to encourage the team to self-manage.
  -  A Business Analyst will typically create project requirements for the team.
  -  Product Owner works with the team to deliver the product.
  -  There's a shared responsibility between the Product Owner and the Development Team.
  -  The product owner owns the product.
  -  They're responsible for setting the direction and prioritizing the work.
  -  They (PO) own the product and have the authority to make real-time decisions.
  -  A **product manager** works on the long-term strategy for a product. They'll create the budget and look at competing products.
  -  A product backlog is a ranked list of different features that the product owner would like included in the product.
# 05.02.2023 Agile Foundations: Kanban Overview
 - Kanban is a scheduling system that was used in Lean manufacturing.
 -  The Kanban system is actually a popular way to apply **lean thinking** to software development. 
 -  **Lean thinking** is about focusing on **what's valuable to the customer** and then continuously improving the product over time.
 -  Remember that **agile teams** focused on **continuous delivery of valuable software**, but **lean** also emphasizes people over **process**.
 -  Summarize lean thinking into **two** core values. You should have **respect for people** and **continuously improve**.
 -  A Kanban board is a swimlane diagram with four more columns. These columns typically have the labels Stories, To-Do, Doing, and Done. Scrum teams will call this the task board because they use yellow sticky notes to keep track of their tasks.
 -  Remember that agile teams should avoid multitasking
 -  Scrum calls itself in "empirical process control framework." It's a framework for the team to run small experiments and get feedback from the customer on how to improve the product. So you can use the Scrum framework to help your team embrace a more agile mindset. But Scrum isn't agile and agile isn't Scrum. It's just that Scrum is still the most popular way for teams to embrace the mindset when delivering products.
# 05.02.2023 Agile Foundations: XP Practicing
- A few of these practices, are **Agile planning**, **continuous integration**, **software Re-factoring**, and **test driven development**.
- Most Agile teams already use some form of XP's Agile planning. One of the most popular are Agile user stories.
- XP also encourages something called continuous integration.
- Finally, XP teams try to create tests for their software before they actually start development. This is called **test-driven development** (**TDD**), and it helps developers understand how the software will work before they actually start coding.
# 01.01.2023 Agile Foundations: Agile Teams
- Should be able to Ask tough questions about the way they work and be open to continuous improvement. 
- First Step: Focus on the **Why**:
- When you look at agile practices, don't think about mastering them, instead think about the **reasoning behind them**.
- Why does shorter sprints improve our team‘s agility? This questions will help us so much more when we’r trying to change our team’s mindset. 
- Why we’re doing things differtly,  then we’ll be much better off as an Agile Team. 
- Be open to continuous improvement
# 01.01.2023 Agile Foundations: Agile Principle
- first rumblings of common Agile roles and practices (P1)
- Welcoming changes when we’re working in our cone of uncertainty (P2) 
- Continuous delivery as Measure of Progress (P3,P7) refer to continuous software delivery in weeks as Measure of Progress ----> That’s why most Agile teams deliver in short iterations called Sprints.
- How customers should work closely with the development team (P4) --- > PO role: this is commonly a customer representative who sits with the team and guides them as they deliver the product.  
- Small, Motivated self-organized team of generalists --- > that’s why most Agile teams are cross-functional and self-organized, they should be small teams of generalist that work together to deliver the product (P5,11).
- Describe the importance of face-to-face interaction/conversation (P6). That’s why many Agile teams write User Stories.
- Start to introduce you to the idea of prioritizing high-value work (P1,8,9,10) --- > the Agile Team will use something like a Product Backlog. It’s here, where the PO will identify what the customer values the most. The PO will work with the team to simplify this functionality. And as something that can be delivered in a short Sprint. 
Encourage the team to meet frequently to discuss process improvement (P12). That’s why most Agile teams have a retrospective. 
# 01.01.2023 Agile Foundations: Agile Principle
- Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the Shorter timescale.
- Agile processes promote Sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely. 
- Predictable = Sustainable-and-constant 
- But what does it mean Deliver predictably? We’ve seen in the Penny game that you can deliver a small stream of work quickly through a system. 
# 01.01.2023 Agile Foundations: Sprint
- A timeboxed iteration of work intended to deliver a shippable portion of a product in shorter time scale. 
- In Scrum, all the players work together simultaneously to push the same ball closer to the goal. 
- There is no multitasking. An instead, everyone on the team is focused on the one ball. That’s the same way all members of the scrum development team work, simultaneously to complete a small set of tasks. They work together in a short amount of time to move the product closer to the goal. 
# 01.01.2023 Agile Foundations: Handing off tasks to different people
- Finishing work on a task and then giving it to another person or department for processing.
- Challenge: is that encourages large batches of work to go through the system. This is usually called Queue Size.
- So, it’s almost like an expressway where a few lanes of traffic are backed up and others are empty. Some cars would be crawling forward, while others would be speeding along. So at some point, everyone’s either speeding or crawling. This relationship between how these batches of work decrease your overall efficiency is not always easy to show. If you can keep your batch sizes smaller, it will make it easier to limit your handoffs. 

# 01.01.2023 Agile Foundations: Principle 2
- Welcoming changes.
# 01.01.2023 Agile Foundations: Principle 3,7 
- Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.
- refer to continuous software delivery in weeks as a measure of progress. That's why most Agile teams deliver in short iterations called sprints.
- Welcome changeing requirments, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer‘s competetive advantage
# 01.01.2023 Agile Foundations: Principle 4
- describes how customers should work closely with the development team. Later on, you'll see a role called the Product Owner. This is commonly a customer representative who sits with the team and guides them as they deliver the product.
# 01.01.2023 Agile Foundations: Principle 5, 11
- Agile teams should be Motivated and self-organized. They should also work closely without business people when delivering the product.
- Small, Motivated self-organized team of generalists
- Describes how customers should work closely with the development team. Later on, you'll see a role called the Product Owner. This is commonly a customer representative who sits with the team and guides them as they deliver the product.
- Principles 5 and 11 talk about motivated self-organized teams. That's why most Agile teams are cross-functional and self-organized, they should be small teams of generalists that work together to deliver the product.
# 01.01.2023 Agile Foundations: Principle 6
- Describes the importance of face-to-face conversations. That's why many Agile teams write user stories. Instead of writing out long requirements documents.
# 01.01.2023 Agile Foundations: Principle 1,8,9,10
- Our highest Priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continous delivery of Valuable software
- Start to introduce you to the idea of prioritizing high value work. And Agile team will use something like a product backlog it's here, where the product owner will identify what the customer values the most. The product owner will work with the team to simplify this functionality. And as something that can be delivered in a short sprint.
- Predictable = Sustainable –and-Constant
# 01.01.2023 Agile Foundations: Principle 12
- Encourages the team to meet frequently to discuss process improvement. That's why most Agile teams have a retrospective. Typically it's at the end of every sprint. This is when the team has a face-to-face meeting to think of ways to improve their collaboration.
# 01.01.2023 Agile Foundations: Waterfall Model
- Plan --> Analyze -- > Design -- >  Code -- >  Test -- >  Deploy
- Agile is a Mindset. It’s a way to think about your work.
- Waterfall is concrete process. It’s strict guidelines for how you should do your work.
# 01.01.2023 Agile Foundations: The Agile Mindset
- Many organizations that try to use Agile to improve thier product delivery. They might 
  - Rename Project Manegers into Scrum Masters.
  - They'll break down the requirments into Agile-style user stories.
- To get real benifit from agile, you have to start by adderssing your team's mindset. 
- If you see agile is just an updated set of project management tools, then you'll probebly be disappointed.
- You don't want your team to be focused on agile practices, instead you want to be focused on thinking like an agile team.
- 
# 01.01.2023 Agile Foundations: Challenges with software manufacturing
- Plan the work, then work to plan. 
- Traditional Planning
  - Plan the Project
  - Execute the Project
  - Test the Project
- **When you're developing software, you're doing a mixture of building and learning**.
- Most software products have to deal with something called the **Cone of Uncertainty**
  - The best way of to think about The Cone of Uncertainty is to imagine the relationship between time, knowledge and cost.
  - The Corner of Uncertainty is the widest a few days before landfall. Then the cone narrows as the meteorologists gain more knowledge and time passes.
  -  The problem is that the meteorologists (Refer to Example) know the most about the storm when it's too late. This is also one of the biggest challenges with delivering software products. You know the most about what it takes to deliver the product only when you're nearly finished.
  -  So many of the decisions that you make at the start of your project will be the ones that need to change. Unfortunately, as you get closer to the end of your project, it also gets more expensive to make changes. 
  -  So you need to find the balance between making the minimum amount of decisions to get started, but still give yourself enough flexibility to make changes. This **balance between making decisions and having a flexibility to make changes is one of the key parts of the agile mindset**. That way you can help make lasting decisions, even when you're working within a cone of uncertainty.
 
# 01.01.2023 Agile Foundations: Parking lots
- Pareto principle
