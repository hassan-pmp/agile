# 12.02.2023 Public Speaking Foundations: Lesson 2: Outline your speech
-  four different types of outlines. **Descriptive**, **problem/solution**, **chronological**, and **regional**.
-  In a **descriptive** presentation, you break down your topic into key informational categories. This can be a great choice for informational presentations.
-  This type of outline (**problem/solution**) focuses first on audience pain points then pivots to easing the pain. The problem/solution outline is a great choice for many persuasive presentations. 
-  A **chronological** outline either goes forward or backward in time. This can be a great choice for informational presentations. The chronological approach can also be a good choice for an inspirational address. If you're using a motivational story as the basis of an address, use the chronological what happens next approach, to make sure you cover all the major plot points.  
- **Regional** is frequently used for informational presentations as well.
# 12.02.2023 Public Speaking Foundations: Lesson 1: Know why you're talking
- audience will be falls into one of three main categories. You'll want to **persuade**, **inform**, or **inspire** your audience.
- In a **persuasive presentation**, your aim is to change audience behavior.
- But in an **informational presentation**, your main purpose is to educate.
- In an **inspirational** or entertaining presentation, you'll want to emotionally move your audience.
# 05.02.2023 Agile Foundations: Start an agile transformation
- With any large organizational change, it's difficult to see where to start. 
 - Up to Bottom
  - Starting from the top down could get you a lot of executive support, but the teams might not know much about the agile mindset
 - Bottom to Up
  -  Starting from the bottom up will get you going pretty quickly, but you might run into trouble with executive support. 
 - You might be surprised to hear that a lot of agile transformations fail before they even get started. That's because a lot of organizations have a **culture** which has a hard time embracing big changes.
 - An organizational culture is an unseen and unspoken way of working. 
 - One of the most common types of organizational culture is the **control culture**.
 - This is a culture that's based on a hierarchy of different supervisors, directors, and executives. Everyone in these organizations knows exactly who they work for and knows who works for them.
# 05.02.2023 Agile Foundations: Major agile challenges
- Biggest challenge in large organizations is underestimating how radical this transformation can be.
- If you want to embrace a more agile mindset, then you have to change your whole relationship with uncertainty.
- Eliminating handoffs
- Working Software as status updates 
# 05.02.2023 Agile Foundations: Planning Poker
 - This is a consensus building technique that was adapted from a group decision-making tool called **Wideband Delphi**.
 -  Planning poker helps groups of people estimate how much effort it would take for the whole team to finish a user story.
 -  It's a way to get a shared understanding about all the development and design challenges to deliver that small batch of work.
# 05.02.2023 Agile Foundations: Combat groupthink
 - Agile Value: One of the most important ideas in the Agile Manifesto is that teams should favor **individuals** and **interactions** over **processes** and **tools**.
 - Everyone on an Agile team should always be **teaching** and **learning**.
 - They could end up doing something called groupthink. That's when a few experts make a convincing argument and the rest of the team just follows along. 
# 05.02.2023 Agile Foundations: Scrum Master
- SM closer to being a trainer or a coach.
- They can even be an administrator.
- Scrum Master as both a **bulldozer** and a **shield**. They bulldoze through **obstacles**, but they also **protect the team from outside interference**. These obstacles can be **contacting someone**, **setting up meetings** or even **ordering software**. 
-  The Scrum Master might not have the authority to stop the manager, but they can let them know how their actions will interfere with the product delivery. This type of confrontation can be very political, so the Scrum Master should be able to manage conflict. They might just call them a **servant leader** or an **Agile coach**.
# 05.02.2023 Agile Foundations: Improve Customer Collaboration
  - Dangers of Equaing Agile and traditional Roles
   -  This way of thinking can lead to a lot of problems. For one, it can move people into these roles when they may not be the best fit. 
   -  And two, it plays into a stereotype that organizational changes are always step-by-step.
  - Agile mindset is a big change and radically different from how most organizations operate.
  -  A Scrum Master is a completely different role. Here you'll act as a coach. Instead of having authority over the team, you'll be encouraging them to take on greater responsibilities. Remember that Agile teams are cross-functional and self-organized. So instead of being a manager, you don't want to encourage the team to self-manage.
  -  A Business Analyst will typically create project requirements for the team.
  -  Product Owner works with the team to deliver the product.
  -  There's a shared responsibility between the Product Owner and the Development Team.
  -  The product owner owns the product.
  -  They're responsible for setting the direction and prioritizing the work.
  -  They (PO) own the product and have the authority to make real-time decisions.
  -  A **product manager** works on the long-term strategy for a product. They'll create the budget and look at competing products.
  -  A product backlog is a ranked list of different features that the product owner would like included in the product.
# 05.02.2023 Agile Foundations: Kanban Overview
 - Kanban is a scheduling system that was used in Lean manufacturing.
 -  The Kanban system is actually a popular way to apply **lean thinking** to software development. 
 -  **Lean thinking** is about focusing on **what's valuable to the customer** and then continuously improving the product over time.
 -  Remember that **agile teams** focused on **continuous delivery of valuable software**, but **lean** also emphasizes people over **process**.
 -  Summarize lean thinking into **two** core values. You should have **respect for people** and **continuously improve**.
 -  A Kanban board is a swimlane diagram with four more columns. These columns typically have the labels Stories, To-Do, Doing, and Done. Scrum teams will call this the task board because they use yellow sticky notes to keep track of their tasks.
 -  Remember that agile teams should avoid multitasking
 -  Scrum calls itself in "empirical process control framework." It's a framework for the team to run small experiments and get feedback from the customer on how to improve the product. So you can use the Scrum framework to help your team embrace a more agile mindset. But Scrum isn't agile and agile isn't Scrum. It's just that Scrum is still the most popular way for teams to embrace the mindset when delivering products.
# 05.02.2023 Agile Foundations: XP Practicing
- A few of these practices, are **Agile planning**, **continuous integration**, **software Re-factoring**, and **test driven development**.
- Most Agile teams already use some form of XP's Agile planning. One of the most popular are Agile user stories.
- XP also encourages something called continuous integration.
- Finally, XP teams try to create tests for their software before they actually start development. This is called **test-driven development** (**TDD**), and it helps developers understand how the software will work before they actually start coding.
# 01.01.2023 Agile Foundations: Agile Teams
- Should be able to Ask tough questions about the way they work and be open to continuous improvement. 
- First Step: Focus on the **Why**:
- When you look at agile practices, don't think about mastering them, instead think about the **reasoning behind them**.
- Why does shorter sprints improve our team‘s agility? This questions will help us so much more when we’r trying to change our team’s mindset. 
- Why we’re doing things differtly,  then we’ll be much better off as an Agile Team. 
- Be open to continuous improvement
# 01.01.2023 Agile Foundations: Agile Principle
- first rumblings of common Agile roles and practices (P1)
- Welcoming changes when we’re working in our cone of uncertainty (P2) 
- Continuous delivery as Measure of Progress (P3,P7) refer to continuous software delivery in weeks as Measure of Progress ----> That’s why most Agile teams deliver in short iterations called Sprints.
- How customers should work closely with the development team (P4) --- > PO role: this is commonly a customer representative who sits with the team and guides them as they deliver the product.  
- Small, Motivated self-organized team of generalists --- > that’s why most Agile teams are cross-functional and self-organized, they should be small teams of generalist that work together to deliver the product (P5,11).
- Describe the importance of face-to-face interaction/conversation (P6). That’s why many Agile teams write User Stories.
- Start to introduce you to the idea of prioritizing high-value work (P1,8,9,10) --- > the Agile Team will use something like a Product Backlog. It’s here, where the PO will identify what the customer values the most. The PO will work with the team to simplify this functionality. And as something that can be delivered in a short Sprint. 
Encourage the team to meet frequently to discuss process improvement (P12). That’s why most Agile teams have a retrospective. 
# 01.01.2023 Agile Foundations: Agile Principle
- Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the Shorter timescale.
- Agile processes promote Sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely. 
- Predictable = Sustainable-and-constant 
- But what does it mean Deliver predictably? We’ve seen in the Penny game that you can deliver a small stream of work quickly through a system. 
# 01.01.2023 Agile Foundations: Sprint
- A timeboxed iteration of work intended to deliver a shippable portion of a product in shorter time scale. 
- In Scrum, all the players work together simultaneously to push the same ball closer to the goal. 
- There is no multitasking. An instead, everyone on the team is focused on the one ball. That’s the same way all members of the scrum development team work, simultaneously to complete a small set of tasks. They work together in a short amount of time to move the product closer to the goal. 
# 01.01.2023 Agile Foundations: Handing off tasks to different people
- Finishing work on a task and then giving it to another person or department for processing.
- Challenge: is that encourages large batches of work to go through the system. This is usually called Queue Size.
- So, it’s almost like an expressway where a few lanes of traffic are backed up and others are empty. Some cars would be crawling forward, while others would be speeding along. So at some point, everyone’s either speeding or crawling. This relationship between how these batches of work decrease your overall efficiency is not always easy to show. If you can keep your batch sizes smaller, it will make it easier to limit your handoffs. 

# 01.01.2023 Agile Foundations: Principle 1
- Our highest Priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continous delivery of Valuab software
# 01.01.2023 Agile Foundations: Principle 2
# 01.01.2023 Agile Foundations: Principle 3,7 
- Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.
- refer to continuous software delivery in weeks as a measure of progress. That's why most Agile teams deliver in short iterations called sprints.
- Welcome changeing requirments, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer‘s competetive advantage
# 01.01.2023 Agile Foundations: Principle 4
- describes how customers should work closely with the development team. Later on, you'll see a role called the Product Owner. This is commonly a customer representative who sits with the team and guides them as they deliver the product.
# 01.01.2023 Agile Foundations: Principle 5, 11
- Agile teams should be Motivated and self-organized. They should also work closely without business people when delivering the product.
- Small, Motivated self-organized team of generalists
- Describes how customers should work closely with the development team. Later on, you'll see a role called the Product Owner. This is commonly a customer representative who sits with the team and guides them as they deliver the product.
- Principles 5 and 11 talk about motivated self-organized teams. That's why most Agile teams are cross-functional and self-organized, they should be small teams of generalists that work together to deliver the product.
# 01.01.2023 Agile Foundations: Principle 6
- Describes the importance of face-to-face conversations. That's why many Agile teams write user stories. Instead of writing out long requirements documents.
# 01.01.2023 Agile Foundations: Principle 1,8,9,10
- Start to introduce you to the idea of prioritizing high value work. And Agile team will use something like a product backlog it's here, where the product owner will identify what the customer values the most. The product owner will work with the team to simplify this functionality. And as something that can be delivered in a short sprint.
- Predictable = Sustainable –and-Constant
# 01.01.2023 Agile Foundations: Principle 12
- Encourages the team to meet frequently to discuss process improvement. That's why most Agile teams have a retrospective. Typically it's at the end of every sprint. This is when the team has a face-to-face meeting to think of ways to improve their collaboration.
# 01.01.2023 Agile Foundations: Waterfall Model
- Plan --> Analyze -- > Design -- >  Code -- >  Test -- >  Deploy
- Agile is a Mindset. It’s a way to think about your work.
- Waterfall is concrete process. It’s strict guidelines for how you should do your work.
# 01.01.2023 Agile Foundations: The Agile Mindset
- Many organizations that try to use Agile to improve thier product delivery. They might 
  - Rename Project Manegers into Scrum Masters.
  - They'll break down the requirments into Agile-style user stories.
- To get real benifit from agile, you have to start by adderssing your team's mindset. 
- If you see agile is just an updated set of project management tools, then you'll probebly be disappointed.
- You don't want your team to be focused on agile practices, instead you want to be focused on thinking like an agile team.
- 
# 01.01.2023 Agile Foundations: Challenges with software manufacturing
- Plan the work, then work to plan. 
- Traditional Planning
  - Plan the Project
  - Execute the Project
  - Test the Project
- **When you're developing software, you're doing a mixture of building and learning**.
- Most software products have to deal with something called the **Cone of Uncertainty**
  - The best way of to think about The Cone of Uncertainty is to imagine the relationship between time, knowledge and cost.
  - The Corner of Uncertainty is the widest a few days before landfall. Then the cone narrows as the meteorologists gain more knowledge and time passes.
  -  The problem is that the meteorologists (Refer to Example) know the most about the storm when it's too late. This is also one of the biggest challenges with delivering software products. You know the most about what it takes to deliver the product only when you're nearly finished.
  -  So many of the decisions that you make at the start of your project will be the ones that need to change. Unfortunately, as you get closer to the end of your project, it also gets more expensive to make changes. 
  -  So you need to find the balance between making the minimum amount of decisions to get started, but still give yourself enough flexibility to make changes. This **balance between making decisions and having a flexibility to make changes is one of the key parts of the agile mindset**. That way you can help make lasting decisions, even when you're working within a cone of uncertainty.
 
# 01.01.2023 Agile Foundations: Parking lots
- Pareto principle
