# 01.01.2023 Agile Foundations: Agile Teams
- Should be able to Ask tough questions about the way they work and be open to continuous improvement. 
- First Step: Focus on the **Why**:
- When you look at agile practices, don't think about mastering them, instead think about the **reasoning behind them**.
- Why does shorter sprints improve our team‘s agility? This questions will help us so much more when we’r trying to change our team’s mindset. 
- Why we’re doing things differtly,  then we’ll be much better off as an Agile Team. 
- Be open to continuous improvement
# 01.01.2023 Agile Foundations: Agile Principle
- first rumblings of common Agile roles and practices (P1)
- Welcoming changes when we’re working in our cone of uncertainty (P2) 
- Continuous delivery as Measure of Progress (P3,P7) refer to continuous software delivery in weeks as Measure of Progress ----> That’s why most Agile teams deliver in short iterations called Sprints.
- How customers should work closely with the development team (P4) --- > PO role: this is commonly a customer representative who sits with the team and guides them as they deliver the product.  
- Small, Motivated self-organized team of generalists --- > that’s why most Agile teams are cross-functional and self-organized, they should be small teams of generalist that work together to deliver the product (P5,11).
- Describe the importance of face-to-face interaction/conversation (P6). That’s why many Agile teams write User Stories.
- Start to introduce you to the idea of prioritizing high-value work (P1,8,9,10) --- > the Agile Team will use something like a Product Backlog. It’s here, where the PO will identify what the customer values the most. The PO will work with the team to simplify this functionality. And as something that can be delivered in a short Sprint. 
Encourage the team to meet frequently to discuss process improvement (P12). That’s why most Agile teams have a retrospective. 
# 01.01.2023 Agile Foundations: Agile Principle
- Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the Shorter timescale.
- Agile processes promote Sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely. 
- Predictable = Sustainable-and-constant 
- But what does it mean Deliver predictably? We’ve seen in the Penny game that you can deliver a small stream of work quickly through a system. 
# 01.01.2023 Agile Foundations: Sprint
- A timeboxed iteration of work intended to deliver a shippable portion of a product in shorter time scale. 
- In Scrum, all the players work together simultaneously to push the same ball closer to the goal. 
- There is no multitasking. An instead, everyone on the team is focused on the one ball. That’s the same way all members of the scrum development team work, simultaneously to complete a small set of tasks. They work together in a short amount of time to move the product closer to the goal. 
# 01.01.2023 Agile Foundations: Handing off tasks to different people
- Finishing work on a task and then giving it to another person or department for processing.
- Challenge: is that encourages large batches of work to go through the system. This is usually called Queue Size.
- So, it’s almost like an expressway where a few lanes of traffic are backed up and others are empty. Some cars would be crawling forward, while others would be speeding along. So at some point, everyone’s either speeding or crawling. This relationship between how these batches of work decrease your overall efficiency is not always easy to show. If you can keep your batch sizes smaller, it will make it easier to limit your handoffs. 
# 01.01.2023 Agile Foundations: Principle 8
- Agile Processus promote sustainable Developern. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to Maintain a constant pace indefinitely. 
- Predictable = Sustainable –and-Constant
# 01.01.2023 Agile Foundations: Principle 5 & 11
- Small, Motivated self-organized team of generalists
# 01.01.2023 Agile Foundations: Principle 1
- Our highest Priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continous delivery of Valuab software![image](https://user-
# 01.01.2023 Agile Foundations: Principle 3
- Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale
# 01.01.2023 Agile Foundations: Principle 2
- Welcome changeing requirments, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer‘s competetive advantage
# 01.01.2023 Agile Foundations: Principle 4, 5, 11
Agile teams should be Motivated and self-organized. They should also work closely without business people when delivering the product.

# 01.01.2023 Agile Foundations: Waterfall Model
- Plan --> Analyze -- > Design -- >  Code -- >  Test -- >  Deploy
- Agile is a Mindset. It’s a way to think about your work.
- Waterfall is concrete process. It’s strict guidelines for how you should do your work.
# 01.01.2023 Agile Foundations: The Agile Mindset
- Many organizations that try to use Agile to improve thier product delivery. They might 
  - Rename Project Manegers into Scrum Masters.
  - They'll break down the requirments into Agile-style user stories.
- To get real benifit from agile, you have to start by adderssing your team's mindset. 
- If you see agile is just an updated set of project management tools, then you'll probebly be disappointed.
- You don't want your team to be focused on agile practices, instead you want to be focused on thinking like an agile team.
- 
# 01.01.2023 Agile Foundations: Challenges with software manufacturing
- Plan the work, then work to plan. 
- Traditional Planning
  - Plan the Project
  - Execute the Project
  - Test the Project
- **When you're developing software, you're doing a mixture of building and learning**.
- Most software products have to deal with something called the **Cone of Uncertainty**
  - The best way of to think about The Cone of Uncertainty is to imagine the relationship between time, knowledge and cost.
  - The Corner of Uncertainty is the widest a few days before landfall. Then the cone narrows as the meteorologists gain more knowledge and time passes.
  -  The problem is that the meteorologists (Refer to Example) know the most about the storm when it's too late. This is also one of the biggest challenges with delivering software products. You know the most about what it takes to deliver the product only when you're nearly finished.
