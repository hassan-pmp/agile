* Sharing is Caring.
* Fail Early, Fail Fast, Fail Often.
* The Genius Myth is the tendency that we as humans need to ascribe the success of a team to a single person/leader.
* Although a measure of technical leadership is expected at higher levels, not all leadership is directed at technical problems. Leaders improve the quality of the people around them, improve the team’s psychological safety, create a culture of teamwork and collaboration, defuse tensions within the team, set an example of Google’s culture and values, and make Google a more vibrant and exciting place to work.
